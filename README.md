Based on the CIFAR10 example on TensorFlow. Reconfiguring it to run my own images and data.

I removed the "LICENSE HEADERS" in the code because it was getting kinda cluttered. My apologies if I violate any license laws. I'm new to this open source thing, so drop me an email at samuelchin91@gmail.com and tell me that I'm doing it wrong and this is not allowed. This code is for personal use and nothing else.

Successful Runs:

1. Street View House Number Data Set from http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/ 
  * After training, I cropped my own images in. 100% accuracy. Wow!
2. Assortment of others that yield promising results.
